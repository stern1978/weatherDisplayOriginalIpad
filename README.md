# weatherDisplayOriginaliPad

I have an original iPad that still powers on with a dock.  My cable provider got rid of the time on their cable box and I didn't have a clock in the room.  So I decided to use the old iPad as a clock, inside temp and weather station.  I found out that most javascript won't run on safari last supported.
